# Obstacle-avoiding-robot

This project is an Obstacle Avoiding Robot designed to autonomously navigate its environment by detecting and avoiding obstacles in its path. The robot uses distance sensors to continuously scan the area in front of it and makes real-time decisions to change direction when an obstacle is detected. This project demonstrates basic concepts of robotics, embedded systems, sensor integration, and motor control, making it ideal for beginners who want hands-on experience with autonomous robots. The robot can be built using commonly available components and programmed using a microcontroller such as Arduino.
